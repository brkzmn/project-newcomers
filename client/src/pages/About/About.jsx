            People who were forced to leave their own countries for the wrong
            reasons and deserve a new beginning have found a safe place in the
            Netherlands, and full of opportunities. Our mission is to help new
            comers connect to people that have already gone through a lot during
            their integration phase and introduce them to a lot of opportunities
            to help them get up to speed, and set them up on the right way to
            achieve what they aim at.
