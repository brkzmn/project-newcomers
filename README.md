`TODO: Add a nice screenshot of the app!`

# Class 35 final project

This is the final project for the HackYourFuture curriculum we did as a class using the MERN stack by following the agile methodology with our team and a group of mentors. A quick guide to what we built:

> NlLink is a social network platform to connect locals and newcomers in the Netherlands. Users match based on their interests and province, messaging between users and create and join the events are core features of NlLink.

## 1. Setup

First, to setup all the directories run the following in the main directory:

`npm install`

`npm run setup`

The first command will install `cypress` and some small libraries needed for running the rest of the commands. The second will go into the `client` and `server` directories and set those up to be ran.

In the `client` and `server` directory there are two `.env.example` files. Create a copy and rename that to `.env`. Then follow the instructions in those files to fill in the right values.

To run the app in dev mode you can run the following command in the main directory:

`npm run dev`

### 2.1 Client structure

- `public` || public facing client code
- `__tests__` || any `jest` tests for specific components will be in a `__tests__` folder on the same level
- `__testUtils__` || any code that is only being used in the tests is put in the `__testUtils__` folder to separate that away from the rest of the code
- `components` || all of our shared components that are used over multiple pages
- `hooks` || all of our custom hooks
- `pages` || the page components of our app, any routing will go between these components
- `pages/components` || components used specifically on those pages
- `util` || any utility functions that can be used anywhere on the client side
- `index.jsx` || the start point of the client

### 2.2 Cypress structure

- `fixtures` || any data/files that `cypress` needs can be placed here
- `integration` || all of our tests are in here, separated in folders based on the pages in our app
- `plugins` || any plugins for our `cypress` configuration can be placed here
- `support` || custom commands and other support files for `cypress` can be placed here

### 2.3 Server structure

- `__tests__` || any `jest` tests for the api endpoints as that is our testing strategy for the backend
- `__testUtils__` || any code that is only being used in the tests is put in the `__testUtils__` folder to separate that away from the rest of the code
- `controllers` || all of our controller functions that interact with the database
- `db` || all of our configuration for the database
- `models` || all of our `mongoose` models will be placed here
